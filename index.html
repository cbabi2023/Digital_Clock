            div manily used for creating organizing layouts , making main layout for
        webpage structure but 
    
            span of other hand is used to style inline words or content for example:
        
                if there is a sentence in which "This is a blue color " (to blue
                the blue letter span is used as "This is a <span styles.....> blue</span> color")-->

        <!-- 5th make separate <div> for each span and its details because 
            the details need to be arranged in row way but when they given in one div 
        they form a column form and when they are given separate <div> element
            they are in row form -->
